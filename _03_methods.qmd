# Methodology & Tool Deployed

Employing NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, time series forecasting algorithms like SARIMAX, Flask or Power BI for interactive dashboards, and Python as the primary programming language will provide practical experience in implementing comprehensive air quality forecasting solutions.

For each data source, Python’s SQLAlchemy package was used to connect to the existing Railway Postgres databases, extract the relevant information, and write it into a centralized capstone database. Raw Data was already curated and pre-processed by the EPA website. 

Data cleaning procedures were  required to handle missing values, or to correct inconsistencies, nevertheless we ensured that all data was in a tidy format. 
This involved normalizing or standardizing data as necessary and creating new features through aggregation to enhance the model’s performance.

`The most common method used in time series forecasting is known as ARIMA model. We will use an extended version called SARIMAX (*Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Averages with exogenous factor*)`


## What is Prophet?

Prophet is an open-source forecasting tool developed by Meta, designed for forecasting time series data. It is suited for datasets with strong seasonal, monthly, weekly, or daily patterns, and it handles missing data and outliers well. `We utilized prophet to gain a quick understanding of our AQI patterns`, seeking to understand basic trends before conducting a more thorough analysis.

Key features of Prophet include seasonality detection and holiday incorporation, while providing easy use and understanding for users. 
We can use this software to get complex understanding from simple application.

To conduct this analysis, we prepare data into a two column table, date and AQI. Prophet uses the trends of past data to highlight similarities over days of the year, weeks, months, and seasons. From this, prophet is able to generate its predictions, cross validate, and give performance metrics such as mean absolute percentage error to quantify the accuracy of the results.

## What is SARIMAX algorithm?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

- The SARIMAX model is used when the data sets have seasonal cycles. 
- In the dataset converning the air quality/aqi there is a seasonal pattern which we have explianed in the above section.
- ARIMA is a model that can be fitted to time series data in order to better understand or predict future points in the series
- SARIMAX is particularly useful for forecasting time series data that exhibit both trend and seasonality.

Here's a breakdown of its components:

There are 3 distinct integer (p,d,q) that are used to parametrize ARIMA models, Because of that, ARIMA models are denoted withthe notation ARIMA(p,d,q).

Together these 3 parameters account for seasonality, trend and noise in datasets:

1. *Seasonal*: Accounts for recurring patterns or cycles in the data.
2. *AutoRegressive (AR)*: Uses past values to predict future values.
3. *Integrated (I)*: Applies differencing to make the time series stationary.
4. *Moving Average (MA)*: Uses past forecast errors in the prediction.
5. *eXogenous factors (X)*: Incorporates external variables that may influence the forecast.

We are trying to find the right `p,d, q hyperparameters` to correctly forecast and predict the aqi values.
Those values are crucial and have be near idal to have reliable forecasts.
