# Methods

## Tools Deployed
Python will be the primary programming language used to conduct this analysis. We will also use R language in statistical applications where necessary.

To perform our analysis, we will employ NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation. Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Time Series forecasting algorithms such as Prophet and SARIMAX.

We will address data inconsistencies, missing values and ensure that data is in a tidy format.
We may need to normalize or standardize data if necessary and create new features through aggregation to enhance the model’s performance.

### What is Prophet?
Prophet is an open-source forecasting tool developed by Meta, designed for forecasting time series data. It is suited for datasets with strong seasonal, monthly, weekly, or daily patterns, and it handles missing data and outliers well. We utilized prophet to gain a quick understanding of our AQI patterns, seeking to understand basic trends before conducting a more thorough analysis.

Key features of Prophet include seasonality detection and holiday incorporation, while providing easy use and understanding for users. 
We can use this software to get complex understanding from simple applications.

To conduct this analysis, we prepare data into a two column table, date and AQI. Prophet uses the trends of past data to highlight similarities over days of the year, weeks, months, and seasons. From this, prophet is able to generate its predictions, cross validate, and give performance metrics such as mean absolute percentage error to quantify the accuracy of the results.

### What is SARIMAX?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
The most common method used in time series forecasting is known as the ARIMA model. We will use an extended version called SARIMAX (*Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Averages with exogenous factor*)

Here's a breakdown of its components: There are three distinct integers (p,d,q) that are used to parametrize SARIMAX models. Because of that, ARIMA models are denoted with the notation SARIMAX(p,d,q).
Together these three parameters account for seasonality, trend, and noise in datasets:

1. *Seasonality (S)*: Accounts for recurring patterns or cycles in the data.
2. *AutoRegressive (AR)*: Uses past values to predict future values.
3. *Integrated (I)*: Applies differencing to make the time series stationary.
4. *Moving Average (MA)*: Uses past forecast errors in the prediction.
5. *eXogenous factors (X)*: Incorporates external variables that may influence the forecast.

We are trying to find the right p, d, q hyperparameters to correctly forecast and predict the AQI values.

The SARIMAX model is used when the data sets have seasonal cycles. In the dataset concerning the air quality/AQI there is a seasonal pattern which we have explained in the above section. SARIMAX is a model that can be fitted to time series data in order to better understand or predict future points. SARIMAX is particularly useful for forecasting time series data that exhibits both trends and seasonality.

### Akaike Information Criteria (AIC)?
The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is a measure used to compare different statistical models. It helps in model selection by balancing the goodness of fit and the complexity of the model. Used to measure of a statistical model, the AiC quantifies the goodness of fit and its simplicity.When comparing two models, the one with the lower AIC is generally "better".

Here’s how to interpret the AIC value:

- *AIC Value*: A lower AIC value indicates a better-fitting model. It means the model has a good balance between accuracy and complexity.
- *Comparative Measure*: AIC is most useful when comparing multiple models. The model with the lowest AIC among a set of candidate models is generally preferred.
- *Penalty for Complexity*: AIC includes a penalty for the number of parameters in the model. This discourages overfitting by penalizing models that use more parameters without a corresponding improvement in fit.

### Train and Test
Rigorous validation is paramount to establishing the model's reliability and practical application. To ensure the model's generalizability, we will employ a train-test split. This approach safeguards against overfitting by exposing the model to unseen data, allowing for a more accurate assessment of its predictive capabilities.

By partitioning the dataset, we can:

- *Evaluate performance*: Measure the model's accuracy on unseen data.
- *Detect overfitting*: Identify discrepancies between training and testing performance.
- *Assess generalization*: Determine the model's ability to handle new data.
- *Quantify reliability*: Calculate confidence intervals for prediction accuracy.
- *Iteratively improve*: Use insights to refine the model.

This rigorous process underpins the credibility and utility of our research findings.
To split the data, we follow the recommended `70:30` ratio, 70% of the data is the training data, and 30% of the data is the testing data.
