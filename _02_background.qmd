# Background
Federal regulation of air quality in the United States began in 1955 with the Air Pollution Control Act. This new piece of legislation provided the funds for initial research in air quality and pollution in the US. Using this and privately funded research, congress passed the Clean Air Act of 1963, putting into law the first federal regulation regarding control of air pollution. This established a new federal program within the US Public Health Service, dedicated to the monitoring and control of air quality. In 1967, congress passed the Air Quality Act, giving more federal oversight and enforcement policies. With this act, the government conducted extensive monitoring on interstate air pollution. This all led to the passing of the 1970 Clean Air Act, meant to restrict and regulate emissions, measure and reduce pollutant particles, and address upcoming pollution threats (Environmental Protection Agency).

Also created in 1970, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) implemented and monitored the requirements established by these rulings. These would affect not just federal lands and roads, but all companies operating within the United States. Enforcement authority was expanded to allow upholding these established standards, and prevent companies from circumventing the law.  Much of the turnaround in the quality of air in the US over the past fifty years can be attributed to these regulations. In 1990, when deaths due to air quality were first measured, an estimated 135,000 Americans died. By 2010 that number had dropped to 71,000 (Zhang et al.). Despite the significant decreases led by the federal guidelines of the late 70s, nearly four in ten Americans still live in places where they are exposed to unhealthy air (American Lung Association).

The EPA developed the Air Quality Index (AQI) in 1999, creating an easily understood measurement for the quality of the air we breathe. The AQI measures the level of air pollution on a scale from 0 to 500. It is divided into six categories, with 0 to 50 representing good air quality which poses little or no risk to those breathing it in. On the other hand, a score above 300 signifies emergency conditions, an extremely high risk which impacts everyone. This measurement is mainly derived from five major pollutants: Ozone, Particle pollution (2.5μm and 10μm),  Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, and Sulphur Dioxide (Airnow.gov). Poor air quality has been linked to a variety of diseases including respiratory infections, stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease among others (World Health Organization). An estimated seven million premature deaths annually can be attributed to air pollution, or a global mean loss of life expectancy of 2.9 years, quantifying it as the largest environmental risk factor for disease and premature death (Fuller, Landrigan, Balakrishnan, et. al.). Thus, it is important to understand factors that contribute to poor air quality, and outcomes that can be attributed to the state of the AQI.
