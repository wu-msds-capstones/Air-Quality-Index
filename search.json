    "text": "On October 30, 1948, the Donora High School Football team played through a dense smog to complete the game with hundreds of fans in the audience, despite very poor visibility. The team, fueled by resilience, took pride in playing through poor conditions, a testament to the high spirit of the small town. Soon after, calls to the town’s medical offices began flooding in, complaining of difficulty breathing and respiratory issues. Donora, Pennsylvania, was a town of metalworks, built by the American Steel and Wire company and the Donora Zinc Works company, which made up major parts of the town’s economy. The heavy smog and pollution clouds that covered the sky had been viewed as a sign of prosperity, owing to the industrial might that powered their economy. Within just twelve hours, seventeen people would be dead, 1440 seriously affected, and 4470 with mild to moderate conditions—almost half the town’s working population (Jacobs, Burgess, Abbott).\nThis event, known as the Donora Smog of 1948, prompted the country into taking a closer look at the negative impacts of air pollution. Widespread debate surrounding the event led to the first legislation aimed at regulating the air quality within the United States, ushering in a new era of tracking, combatting, and reversing the ill effects of poor air quality. The quality of air we breathe has direct impacts on our health. We must understand the factors that contribute to poor air quality and how we individually and collectively contribute to these changes. Until we can visualize the impact we have on our atmosphere, we will continue behavior that negatively impacts the air around us.\nIn this project, we will focus on the key factors influencing air quality in Portland, Oregon. We aim to understand the complex interplay between various environmental and human-made factors that contribute to high air pollution levels. Initially, we were surprised to discover that Portland, the city we reside in, has some of the best air quality for a city of its size in the United States. This led us to narrow our focus to understanding the factors that contribute to these favorable outcomes in this city.\nOur project aims to develop and validate machine learning models to analyze the various factors influencing air quality. By focusing on Portland in comparison to other large US cities, we hope to find things Portland does that lead to the greater AQI outcomes. Our approach will consider a range of variables, including meteorological conditions, pollution sources, and transit systems. Through this analysis, we aim to provide actionable insights and recommendations for sustaining and improving air quality. By examining both the contributors to clean air and the sources of pollution, we can understand the factors affecting air quality and develop comprehensive strategies for enhancement."

It is suited for datasets with strong seasonal, monthly, weekly, or daily patterns, and it handles missing data and outliers well. We utilized prophet to gain a quick understanding of our AQI patterns, seeking to understand basic trends before conducting a more thorough analysis.\nKey features of Prophet include seasonality detection and holiday incorporation, while providing easy use and understanding for users. We can use this software to get complex understanding from simple applications.\nTo conduct this analysis, we prepare data into a two column table, date and AQI. Prophet uses the trends of past data to highlight similarities over days of the year, weeks, months, and seasons. From this, prophet is able to generate its predictions, cross validate, and give performance metrics such as mean absolute percentage error to quantify the accuracy of the results."

Because of that, ARIMA models are denoted with the notation SARIMAX(p,d,q).\nTogether these three parameters account for seasonality, trend, and noise in datasets:\n\nSeasonality (S): Accounts for recurring patterns or cycles in the data.\nAutoRegressive (AR): Uses past values to predict future values.\nIntegrated (I): Applies differencing to make the time series stationary.\nMoving Average (MA): Uses past forecast errors in the prediction.\neXogenous factors (X): Incorporates external variables that may influence the forecast.\n\nWe are trying to find the right p, d, q hyperparameters to correctly forecast and predict the AQI values."

It helps in model selection by balancing the goodness of fit and the complexity of the model. Here’s how to interpret the AIC value:\n\nAIC Value: A lower AIC value indicates a better-fitting model. It means the model has a good balance between accuracy and complexity.\nComparative Measure: AIC is most useful when comparing multiple models. The model with the lowest AIC among a set of candidate models is generally preferred.\nPenalty for Complexity: AIC includes a penalty for the number of parameters in the model. This discourages overfitting by penalizing models that use more parameters without a corresponding improvement in fit."

Measurements tracked include temperature, wind speed, air pressure, and humidity. Temperature is measured in degrees fahrenheit. Wind speed is measured in knots, which are defined as one nautical mile per hour (equivalent to approximately 1.15mph). Wind speed is important in air quality as winds can blow different pollutants around and move and spread wildfires. Pressure is measured in millibars, where 1013.25 millibars is the standard atmospheric pressure (Earth’s pressure at mean sea level). Finally, humidity is measured in percent relative humidity. This is the amount of water vapor in the air as a percentage of the maximum amount of water vapor possible at a given temperature. Humidity can make it more difficult to breathe and sweat, make the air feel hotter than it is, and prevent air pollutants from dispersing as easily. Indoors, high humidity can trap air, leading to the growth of mold and harmful bacteria. This data was given daily by city, separated into different files by year. Measurements were taken hourly, but pre-calculated in the source database, giving an average value over the twenty four hours and a maximum value."

Criteria gas Carbon Monoxide is measured in parts per million, and is especially dangerous as it is both colorless and odorless. CO binds to hemoglobin in the blood, making the transportation of oxygen around the body more difficult. Nitrogen Dioxide is dangerous to breathe in at high levels. It can cause swelling in the throat, burning, reduced oxygenation of body tissues, and fluid build up in the lungs. It is released in many common combustion reactions including in cars, coal plants, and cigarettes. It is measured in parts per billion. Ozone can harm our ability to breathe, especially in older people, children, and people with asthma. It is measured in parts per million. Sulfur Dioxide, measured in parts per billion, can irritate the eyes, mucous membranes, skin, and respiratory tract. Lead is a toxin which can increase the risk of high blood pressure, cardiovascular problems, and complications during pregnancy. While exposure has gone down significantly in the recent decades after use in gasoline, it still remains a dangerous toxin to breathe in. It is measured in micrograms per cubic meter. PM2.5 and PM10 are particulate matter, small inhalable particles with diameters of 2.5 microns or smaller, and 10 microns or smaller respectively. PM2.5 includes all sorts of common particles, metals, and organic compounds. PM10 includes dust, pollen, molds, and other larger (but still very small) particles. Due to the variability of particles included in the PM classification, there are a wide range of negative health impacts that come from breathing in these particles. PM2.5 and PM10 are measured in micrograms per cubic meter.\nThis data was given daily by city, separated into different files by year. They are sourced from thousands of individual sources, which measure various selections of these pollution sources.

Data was organized in a star schema centered on the air_quality fact table. This table tracks AQI, pollutant, weather and toxin data daily for each location. The first dimension table is the dates table, a serialized list of dates from January 1st, 2015 to December 31st, 2022. Next, we have a locations dimension table, a serialized list of over 1400 cities and towns from around the country. These are labeled by the state, county, and city name, as well as the population and population density, allowing connection to information based on what is given. The aqi_category dimension table is a short list of AQI value categories (Good, Unhealthy, Hazardous, etc.) with their respective AQI value range as minimum and maximum values.\nFinally, the yearly_transit dimension table gives the information for the transit system of the respective city during the specified year attached in the fact table. This table seems counterproductive to not include the location or year of the specified line or even a reference id, but in keeping with star schema, it was decided that this was the best way to reference this information. Understanding the context of a specified line requires joining the table back to the fact table, and joining the location and date tables to that as well.\nEach table has a unique serialized primary key, and all dimension tables are connected via foreign key. Several additional indexes are included on columns that will be queried often. Finally, constraints have been added to limit unusual or impossible data.\nTracking these identifiers independently allows for accurate analysis of changes over time and across different areas, and allows adding new information should we need to update the database.
