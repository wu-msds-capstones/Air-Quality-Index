# Introduction

On October 30, 1948, the Donora High School Football team pushed through a dense smog to complete the game with hundreds of fans in the audience, despite very poor visibility. The team, backed by a sense of resilience, took pride in playing through poor conditions, a testament to the high spirit of the small town. Soon after, calls to the town’s medical offices began rushing in, complaining of difficulty breathing and respiratory issues. Donora, Pennsylvania, was a town of metalworks, built by the American Steel and Wire company and the Donora Zinc Works company, which made up the largest parts of the town’s economy. The heavy smog and pollution clouds that covered the sky were a sign of prosperity. Only twelve hours later, seventeen people would be dead, 1440 seriously affected, and 4470 with mild to moderate conditions, almost half the town’s working population (Jacobs, Burgess, Abbott). This event, the Donora Smog of 1948, would lead the country into taking a close look at the negative impacts of air pollution. Widespread debate surrounding the event would lead to the first legislation regarding the regulation of the air within the United States, ushering in a new era of tracking, combatting, and reversing ill effects of poor air quality. 

The quality of air we breathe has direct impacts on our health. We must understand the factors that contribute to poor air quality and how we personally and collectively contribute to the changes. Until we are able to visualize the impact we have on our atmosphere, we will continue behavior that negatively impacts the air around us. 

In this project, we will be focusing on the key factors contributing to Portland, Oregon’s air quality. We aim to shed light on the complex interplay between various environmental and human-made factors that contribute to high air pollution levels. Initially, we were surprised to learn that Portland, the city we reside in, has some of the best air quality for a city of its size within the United States. This ultimately led us to narrow our focus on the factors that impact and lead to these outcomes within this city. 

This project aims to develop and validate machine learning models for use in analysis of the various factors that influence air quality. 
By focusing on Portland in comparison to other large US cities, we hope to find things Portland does that lead to the greater AQI outcomes. 
Our approach will consider a range of variables, including meteorological conditions, pollution sources, and transit systems. 
Through this analysis, we aim to provide actionable insights and recommendations for sustaining and enhancing air quality. 
By examining both the contributors to clean air and the potential causes of pollution, we can understand air quality factors more accurately and develop comprehensive strategies for improvement.
