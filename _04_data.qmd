# Rapid Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We have a new dataset named metro_1mil.csv. This file was created using a SQL statement that joins all relevant tables, filtering for metropolitan areas with populations less than or equal to 1 million. This approach limits our EDA to mid-sized metropolitan cities, such as Portland, Oregon.

```python
df = pd.read_csv(r'C:\Users\Steve\Downloads\capstone\project-repo\project-workbook-jake-stephane\data\metro_1mil.csv')
```
