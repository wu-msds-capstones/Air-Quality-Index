# Conclusion

After conducting our thorough research, we have landed on these specific recommendations. 

AQI is impacted by six explanatory features:  

- Temperature
- Humidity
- Park Land Area
- Number of Cattle
- City Area
- Population

 Figure 14 shows how each of these features impacts AQI

To improve AQI, a city should:  

- Decrease temperatures
- Increase humidity
- Decrease park land area
- Decrease number of cattle
- Decrease city area
- Decrease population

We also found there are high seasonal trends that show up each year from the time series analysis models.  AQI tends to be highest during late summer to early fall. We can attribute this increase to the increased temperatures and decreased humidity. As climate change raises temperatures and water sources dry up, the seasonal AQI increases will become more severe. We must be aware of the nature of air quality and how it changes at different parts of the year. We should understand how the AQI works and avoid being outside for too long when it reaches more dangerous levels. 

We must focus on the variables that have the greatest impact on the AQI. Of these, we have little control over temperature and humidity, with the exception of fighting climate change. That leaves us with the city and park area, city population, and cattle numbers. City area and population are difficult to address. Population cannot be directly regulated; cities cannot put limits on the number of people moving in. Population, however, is impacted by economics. As the cost of living in certain areas increases, more people will be priced out and forced to move away. This is not a recommendation to raise living costs. That comes with its own set of issues that are outside the scope of this project such as a decrease in the physical and mental health outcomes of the population (Broadbent et al.), which would ultimately be counterproductive to the increase in air quality. 

Some cities, such as Portland, have boundary restrictions to combat urban sprawl (Portland.gov). This increases the need to build vertically, increasing population density. We did not find evidence that population density has a significant impact on the AQI.  Therefore, imposing urban growth boundaries can be useful for addressing land area increases and lead to lower AQI levels.

Next, cattle populations should be decreased.  According to the EPA, 37% of annual methane emissions from human activities are a direct result of livestock. Cattle process food by fermentation within their stomachs. This process breaks food down and produces methane which is released into the atmosphere through flatulence or burps. A single cow can produce up to 264 pounds of methane gas per year. In total, the 1.5 billion cattle raised specifically for meat production emit at least 231 billion pounds of methane annually (EPA). This figure doesn’t include the millions of cattle raised for dairy production. Methane is a powerful short-lived greenhouse gas with a warming impact 86 times stronger than CO2 per unit of mass over a 20-year period. Methane is a precursor gas to Ozone, a criteria gas in the Air Quality Index. Additionally, methane traps heat, increasing the global temperature levels, which, as shown earlier, has negative impacts on the AQI. 

Cattle reduction starts with less of a reliance on red meat and the dairy industry, mainstays of the American diet. This will be a huge shift, taking combined efforts of the citizens, government, and food industry. There will be significant pushback by the dairy and meat industries. Further investments should be made into lab-grown meat research or developing suitable plant-based alternatives. Many people are open to switching to traditional meat and dairy alternatives, but existing offerings still have ways to go with regards to taste and texture. As red meat and dairy consumption goes down, less livestock will need to be kept, and less feeding crops will need to be grown (Congressional Budget Office). It will be a difficult transition but a necessary one. 

Finally, park land area was found to have a negative impact on AQI values. This surprised us as we had hypothesized that increased park land would increase the quality of air. This difference from expectations is likely due to the  use of area as the variable measurement. Certain cities with poor AQI are significantly larger in size such as Phoenix and Los Angeles. Because of how large they are, the amount of park land will similarly be very large in raw square kilometers. Instead, we should have measured park land as a percentage of city area. This would have allowed us to see the proportion of park land within the city limits, which may have had a different result on AQI. 

The 2020 wildfires had a significant impact on the air quality. Wildfires have progressively become more common over time. They not only increase the particulate matter in the air, but burn forests, causing long term damage to the soil and loss of plant life. Particulate matter in the air makes it more difficult to breathe, which is reflected by the increased AQI levels. Not all forest fires are started by man-made sources, but many are. Therefore, when in the woods, one should always obey fire restrictions, especially in the middle of the summer when it’s most dry. If fires are allowed, they should always be watched and never left unattended. They must always be properly extinguished with all embers cool to the touch before leaving. Campsites should be properly cleaned, and all tools used correctly. One should also stay on marked trails, avoiding trampling vegetation which can increase the risk of wildfire spreading (Oregon Wildfire Response and Recovery).

Our other main focus was the reasons for Portland, Oregon’s positive AQI outcomes in comparison to the other large cities. Below, figure 15 shows the rankings of the top and bottom ten average AQI cities from our dataset specified by the six explanatory variables. The top ten highest AQI cities are labeled in red and the top ten lowest AQI cities are shown in green. Additionally, Portland (ranked 4th best AQI) is noted with the cross-hatch lines to compare its measurements with other cities. 

![Figure 15: Top and Bottom ten average AQI cities explained by influential features ranked, Portland highlighted](https://github.com/wu-msds-capstones/Air-Quality-Index/blob/main/images/top_bottom_10_final.png?raw=true)

We have found that Portland has lower average temperatures and a higher average humidity. Portland’s large amount of rainfall likely contributes to the higher amounts of water vapor in the air. Additionally, Portland has a smaller city boundary, due to the urban growth boundary. Both Portland’s cattle and human population are relatively low. Finally, the size of park area ranks towards the middle of large cities in the top and bottom ten. However, as stated earlier, this is a flawed measurement so results from it are inconclusive. 

Our main limitations arise from the lack of data. Importantly, data on the numbers of vehicles on the road could not be found for free which likely has an impact on the AQI. Though we collected public transit information, we didn’t find much of an impact, which may have been more pronounced had we paired it with vehicle information. We could have also taken city walkability and metro/subway numbers into account. Other sources of data that may impact AQI include road and highway location, geographical features, precipitation, industrial manufacturing, wildfire size and locations, agricultural practices, and more. 

Even within our collected dataset, there were significant amounts of missing data. Having a more complete dataset may have given us more accurate information and allowed us to run our models on more cities. By recognizing these limitations, we can better interpret and apply our results, while also identifying areas for future research. To expand our analysis in the future, we would look at finding more complete information, collecting data on other potentially influential factors described in the previous paragraph, and increasing the timespan of data collected.

Ultimately, we have a responsibility to take care of our planet and combat climate change. The worse climate conditions get, the more wildfires will spread, and the worse the air quality will become. As time goes on, with worsening air conditions, more people will catch and even die from preventable conditions sparked by poor air quality.  Water, pollution, food, and financial problems will get worse. One should look at what they can do to make a difference, support those who vouch to make larger changes, and encourage people they know to do the same. While the situation may seem dire, there is hope for progress through concerted and informed efforts.
